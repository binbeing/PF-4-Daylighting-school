The parametric classroom unit model files is available at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TZlcepW9sVQDV8dT0rWkVg (Extraction code: bdi2).
# Description:
The natural lighting prediction tool for primary and secondary school classrooms in the Lingnan region is a tool with the capability to rapidly and accurately predict four types of daylighting design patterns using five daylighting indicators. Users can freely adjust the input parameters by dragging sliders and clicking buttons on the interactive interface. Subsequently, the tool can quickly generate a three-dimensional visualization of the model, bar charts for five indicators, and the daylighting distribution. This provides users with a convenient tool to understand the daylighting effects of different lighting design patterns at the early stages of the design process.
